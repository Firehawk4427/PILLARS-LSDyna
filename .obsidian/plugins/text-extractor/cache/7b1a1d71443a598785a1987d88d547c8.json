LCC23 The absolute value, LCC23), is a load curve ID. If the ID is positive, the load curve defines the vent orifice coefficient which applies to exit hole as a function of time. If the ID is negative, the vent orifice coefficient is defined as a function of relative pressure, Pyie/Prag; see [Anagonye and Wang 1999]. In addition, LCC23 can be defined through *DEFINE_CURVE_FUNCTION. A nonzero value for C23 overrides LCC23. A23 Vent orifice area: GT.0.0: vent orifice area which applies to exit hole LT.0.0: the absolute value [A23] is a part ID, see [Anagonye and Wang, 1999]. With LCA23 =-1, |A23) is a part set representing venting holes. The venting leakage through each venting hole represented by a part in part set |A23| is output to abstat. The area of this part/set becomes the vent orifice area. Airbag pressure will not be applied to part/set |A23] representing venting holes if part/set |A23] is not included in SID, the part set rep- resenting the airbag. EQ.0.0: set A23 to zero if LCA23 is = 0. LCAZ3 Load curve defining the vent orifice area which applies to exit hole as a function of absolute pressure, or LCA23 can be defined through *DEFINE_CURVE_FUNCTION. A nonzero value for A23 overrides LCA23. cp23 Orifice coefficient for leakage (fabric porosity). Set to zero if LC- CP23 is defined below.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
