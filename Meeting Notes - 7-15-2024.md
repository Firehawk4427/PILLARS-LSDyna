## Rithvik's Simulations
- no centerline conditions in the axisymmetric sim
- inlet boundary condition is the only one
- assuming symmetry
- stationary wall at constant 100K, ground is constant 100K as well
- 0 heat flux
- can get wall adjacent temp (avg) using ANSYS
## Marilyn
- around 33000 nodes
