   sw1.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna terminates.
   sw2.    ls-dyna responds with time and cycle numbers.    
   sw3.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   sw4.    a plot state is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swa.    ls-dyna flushes all output i/o buffers.
   swb.    a dynain is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swc.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swd.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna terminates.
   swe.    stop dynamic relaxation just as though convergence
   endtime=time change the termination time
   lpri    toggle implicit lin. alg. solver output on/off.
   nlpr    toggle implicit nonlinear solver output on/off.
