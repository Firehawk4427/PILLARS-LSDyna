Hello Dr. Rabinovitch,

I am a junior in mechanical engineering at Caltech, working on the PILLARS project with Lily. Currently, I am working on making a model of PILLARS in LS-Dyna to simulate the inflation pressure. The end goal of this would be to add in fixed anchors / nodes connecting the structure to a rigid baseplate to model the maximum stress around these anchor points in the case of an off-nominal rocket landing. ![[wind-tunnel-fail.gif|200]]
![[airbag_open_collision_fail.gif|200]]I have two different models that I am working on to get this up and running. The first contains a baseplate with a fabric torus-like mesh above it, and a wind tunnel facing down into PILLARS to simulate the rocket. There have been several issues with this, mainly being I cannot get any fabric mesh to collide with a solid body or rigidwall. I also ran into the issue of the wind tunnel having no effect on the fabric when I scaled the mesh up to the size of PILLARS (100m wide). 
I started working on a separate model to get around these issues by simulating the inflation as a control volume airbag where the leakage / fabric porosity is very high, but then I ran into the same issue with the fabric mesh where any rigidwall I created refused to collide, and the fabric would float off to the void. I have tried using ANSYS forums and the dyna examples on their website as resources, but I could not find anything close to what I'm trying to model for help. If you could provide any resources or advice on where to go from here, I would greatly appreciate it.
Best,
Trey Scott
