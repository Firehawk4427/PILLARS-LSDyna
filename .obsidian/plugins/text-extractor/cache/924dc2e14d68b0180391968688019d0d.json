Hence, if a material is mechanically compressed att =0, V0, or v, the initial relative volume, may be computed and input accordingly (v # V0). The “reference” state is a unique state with respect to which the material stress tensor is. computed. Therefore v is very critical in computing the pressure level in a material. Incorrect choice of vy would lead to incorrect pressure computed. In general, vy is chosen","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
