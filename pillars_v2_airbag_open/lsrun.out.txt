 ctrl-c interrupts ls-dyna and prompts for a sense  switch.
 type the desired sense switch: sw1., sw2., etc. to continue
 the execution.  ls-dyna will respond as explained in the users manual

   sw1.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna terminates.
   sw2.    ls-dyna responds with time and cycle numbers.    
   sw3.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   sw4.    a plot state is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swa.    ls-dyna flushes all output i/o buffers.
   swb.    a dynain is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swc.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swd.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna terminates.
   swe.    stop dynamic relaxation just as though convergence
   endtime=time change the termination time
