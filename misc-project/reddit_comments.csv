jh70ud0,"Disagree with a ton of this.

> Much cheaper and easier to get full rides or scholarships.

I agree with this point if a student does not qualify for need-based aid. However, for low-income students in particular, top schools will almost certainly give better financial aid than others, because they're pretty much pissing money. Sure, you probably won't get a merit scholarship, but if you qualify for a lot of financial aid, a top school will probably be affordable.

> Degree is just straight up easier

For a lot of students, this isn't a good thing. At least to me, challenge is good. I like to have to think. I don't want to go to college just to sit around with my thumb up my ass for four years.

> If you are smart, it is easier to stand out at your university

Sure, big fish little pond scenario. But also consider that top schools have more resources spread out for students, so you probably don't have to stand out very much to get some great things handed to you.

> Let's be real, every undergraduate degree is the exact same and does not matter

Hard disagree, although this isn't really based on rankings or anything. Schools have different niches. My school (Caltech) will give a very different education than a lot of schools because of its hard focus in research and theory. I'm most familiar with CS as a CS major, and I can say that although all CS majors will learn fundamentally the same things, a CS degree from Caltech will teach more theory and mathematical foundations (i.e. a fuckton more proofs) than somewhere else. Again, this isn't really tied towards rankings, just what a school focuses on teaching its students. It really depends on the professors in each department and what they specialize in. Also, just putting academics aside for a moment, college isn't just education‚Äîit is a full experience. Sure, it's only four years of your life, but you're getting a full package. So maybe the major on your degree will be the same, but your experiences will be a lot different school to school.

> If you want to apply to graduate or med school, your extracurricular activities and personality matter 100% more than where you got your undergrad

I agree with this. However, I will say that the resources that your undergrad provides can help a ton in grad school applications. Also, some schools *do* get advantages in admissions. Of course, anyone from any random undergrad who works hard can get into whatever grad school they want, but it's easier for some depending on the school they go to.

I don't want to use this post as like a jerk-off session for prestige whoring, but I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't consider prestige when applying to colleges.

I'm a transgender man, and I've always had an innate sense of wrongness because of my sex, like I subconsciously knew that something was up. In the example you cited, with the only difference between a trans woman and a guy that likes to dress and act like a woman is the pronouns they like to use, you're leaving out the deep dissatisfaction with gender the trans woman feels.

And, of course, social identification is massive to many trans people. For me, when I am not recognized as a man, and am referred to in a feminine sense, it agonizes me. While pronoun usage seems like a minute issue that one could grow out of quickly, to me, at least, they're more of a representation of my public manhood, and when I am referred to as she/her, I feel as though I will never be recognized for who I am.",1678323125.0,Gender dysphoria in young people is rising‚Äîand so is professional disagreement,11m4lw8,https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p382

I was really lucky‚ÄîI stumbled upon a list of American boarding schools (something I didn't know existed) and picked my favorites. I got into 5, chose my current school. The boarding school application process is very, very similar to the college process. I took the SSAT, wrote essays, submitted transcripts, wrote about my activities, and interviewed. I will also say that I am not rich in the slightest! I grew up on food stamps and even now my parents make about $50,000 (mind you, this is for 2 households, since they're divorced). I got a full ride to each school I got into; these schools offer pretty decent financial aid. Out of our ~$65,000 tuition, I pay $50.

Grades definitely aren't everything. I had a rough freshman year due to family problems. 


I've been incredibly privileged to attend a feeder school. I will say, though, that they *are* incredibly difficult. As someone who's experienced two ends of the high school spectrum, the difference is massive. I'd definitely recommend going to a boarding school if you can handle dealing with both hard work and social life away from home, though!

hhsm7in,"That's not luck. Financial aid is just receiving help because we were not given that help from the get-go. Also, a lot of poor people don't get free college. Even if we're low-income, we're often hit with a ton of loans. 

Sure, you could argue that you're unlucky because you didn't choose to be born into a privileged household, but by this point, it's just the scales evening out.

hgb00jq,"Most of these settlements were developed before cars were commonplace. Most car-dependent infrastructures were developed because they would provide convenience in these areas, not the opposite way around. Farms were still incredibly spread out two-hundred years ago; many rural communities were built around the agriculture industry, and thus many, many people live outside of city limits. This didn't happen because legislators developed roads to propel the personal transportation industry. 

I don't think you're getting the picture of just how large and spread out the United States is. It is over fifteen times larger than the largest country in Europe, France. Even with a large population of over three-hundred million people, roughly 20% of people live in rural communities. Farmers, for example, rely on cars because they cannot run a self-sustainable farm in a community in close enough proximity to walk everywhere. 

With so little people for such a large land mass, it is natural that Americans tend to spread their legs and develop geographically larger communities. Why pack together if there's no need to do so? It simply isn't comfortable. Many people would rather spend extra money on gas and vehicle upkeep to maintain their own land and large homes. I'm not here to argue the environmental harms of cars; Americans rely on personal transportation largely because we like having the room. 

Also, American cities are similar in that public transportation does indeed exist. It might not be as robust as in cities of other nations, but that is also because even many urban American locations are more spread out than other countries'. But most people are indeed able to walk to a grocery store, or a convenience store, or whatever they'd like. You just run into troubles when you're living in a spread out community where it is simply not viable to run public transportation to each location you'd need.",1634004923.0,do you think teens should have a curfew? do you have one?,q5trjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/q5trjw/do_you_think_teens_should_have_a_curfew_do_you/
hga812p,"That's absolutely untrue. If anything, the nation was even more spread out and clumped into tiny communities who relied upon each other moreso before World War 2. Much of the urban flight came around that time, so if anything, accessibility has gotten easier for Americans.",1633991616.0,do you think teens should have a curfew? do you have one?,q5trjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/q5trjw/do_you_think_teens_should_have_a_curfew_do_you/
hga7bkg,"I don't think you understand how physically large the United States, and just how rural a huge chunk of the nation is. While I don't disagree that the US needs to sink more funding into public transportation, many areas simply are too rural or spread out to make public transportation efficient enough to make cars obsolete. Thus, teenagers need cars to often get to school (if they don't want to ride the bus).

Also, to your comment about ""why would a teen need to go a town over?""‚Äîagain, towns in the US can be very small, and there may be stores or entertainment venues that cannot be accessed in a given teen's town. Also, there are many, many towns in the United States‚Äî19,495 incorporated communities exactly, and that isn't counting unincorporated places and villages‚Äîand many of them are very small (with 14,768 having a population of less than 5,000 people). Say a teen wants to see a movie, but they live in a town without a movie theater. They'd just need to take a 25 minute drive to the next big-ish town over, no big deal. I am one of the first to deride the United States and its system of transportation, but your arguments just miss a lot of nuance.",1633991270.0,do you think teens should have a curfew? do you have one?,q5trjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/q5trjw/do_you_think_teens_should_have_a_curfew_do_you/
