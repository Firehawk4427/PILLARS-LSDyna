For temperature variations a load curve, LCT, may be defined. Ler Optional load curve ID defining temperature of input gas as a function of time. This overrides T. LeMT Load curve specifying input mass flow rate or tank pressure versus time. If the tank volume, TVOL, is nonzero the curve ID is assumed to be tank pressure as a function of time. If LCMT =0, then the inflator must be modeled; see Card6. During the dynamic relaxation phase the airbag is ignored unless the curve is flagged to act during dynamic relaxation. TVOL Tank volume which is required only for the tank pressure as a function of time curve, LCMT. LCDT Load curve for time rate of change of temperature (dT/dt) as a function of time. IABT Initial airbag temperature. (Optional, generally not defined.)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
