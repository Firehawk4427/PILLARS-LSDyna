One definition for internal energy is E=MC,T = (Joule) Note that the capital “E” here is the absolute internal energy. Itis not the same as that used in the subsequent *EOS keyword input, or some equations shown for each *EOS_card. This internal energy is often defined with respect to a mass or volume unit. Internal energy per unit mass (also called specific internal energy): E Joule e=pmaT= (Tg) Internal energy per unit current volume: M CyT _ (Joule N ey = Oy T =pCT =\"~ (?=§) Internal energy per unit reference volume: M CT _(Joule N evn = goCT = poCeT = S~ (? - E) ey typically refers to the capital “E” shown in some equations under this “EOS” section. Hence the initial “{nternal energy per unit reference volume”, EO, a keyword input parameter in the “EOS section can be computed from evoli=o = PoCy Tz To convert from ey to ey, simply divide ey by v, . ey = pCyT = [p,,CvT]i - TV’“","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
