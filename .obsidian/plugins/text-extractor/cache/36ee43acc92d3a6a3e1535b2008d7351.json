For the non-control-volume airbag inflation schemes such as Euler/ALE, it is perfectly valid to include physical vent holes to allow the incoming gas to flow out of the airbag chamber skipping the fluid-structure-interaction. In the case of ALE, LS-DYNA performs an internal PID switch for the outgoing gas to enable easy measurement of the time-dependent mass and other related properties. In LS-DYNA 970 revision 58xx and higher, negative inputs are permitted for LCC23 and A23 which invokes different definitions. When LCC23 is less than zero, then abs(LCC23) is interpreted as the definition of the venting leakage coefficient as a function of relative pressure (Pai/Puag) instead of simulation time. When A23 s less than zero, then abs(423) refers to a PID rather than to constant area. This allows LS-DYNA to dynamically compute the leakage area from summing up its individual element area of PID on every compute cycle. Using this approach allows the original Wang-Nefske venting implementation to use actual geometry for area calculations which was not available in earlier versions of LS-DYNA. This approach also provides an alternative way of defining the vent-holes in the airbag where the hole can be first filled using null elements (\"MAT_NULL with shell elform type 9) and refer its PID using a negative value for A23. Since the actual airbag surface will not have any material in the vent-hole, it is recommended to define the part representing the vent-hole using negligible density and stiffness values so realistic stress can be computed around the vent hole.
